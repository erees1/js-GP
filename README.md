## Screenshot

You can see the demo here but I'd really recommend visiting [the site](https://edward-rees.com/gp) to play around with it.

## Quickstart

You can also clone this repo and open the `index.html` file if you prefer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erees1/js-GP.git --recurse-submodules
cd js-GP
open index.html
```
